        <p>Out of all terms of endearment, why daffodil? Don't ask, just go with it.
         Char. Well, nakalagay kasi sa Google results na "Daffodils
          are associated with strength and resilience by virtue of their
           ability to survive and weather through winter storms and 
           come out bright and cheerful in the spring." That's how I perceive
            you, a daffodil. That despite of all the hardships of life, you're
             still standing strong. Yes, you may be broken and shattered in pieces
              and just being held together by little hopes, but you're still standing.
               That's how I perceive you, a strong-willed person.
         It's just sad that you can't see it yourself, so please do 
         know that that's you.</p></div>

      <h1>A Letter From Me To You</h1>
      <br>

    <p style="color:black;">The letter I wrote in the sketch book was actually rushed.
     KSKSKS. So ayun, I just thought, why not make 
     another one? And here I am. First of all, I can't find 
     words to express how much I appreciate the trust 
     and value you've given me. I even think I don't 
     deserve any of that because I feel like I've 
     put less effort into this friendship compared 
     to you. But still, there you are, continuing
      to trust me. Thank you. I may not be so responsive
       at times, but please know that I am willing to
        listen to anything. I may not be there physically, 
        but at least let me listen to you. I also want to 
        tell you to please find some time to think of
         yourself too. I just noticed that you always put
          your problems before yourself. I know it's
           easier to listen to it than doing it, but 
           consider doing that, okay? Don't be too
            hard on yourself. I know there are times 
            you blame yourself for whatever is 
            happening in your life. I know there are
             times you just want to end it all. I know 
             and I understand, but please take care of
              yourself too. To be honest, I don't know how
               to respond to you whenever you confess to me about your
                thoughts about ending <strong><i>it</i></strong>. I don't
                 know what I exactly should say. All I know is that the thought
                   of losing someone you value is a nightmare.
                    It's even more of a nightmare if you haven't 
                    gotten the chance to say everything you want to
                     say to that person. I don't want to experience
                      that again. hehe. You don't have to continue
                       for anyone; continue for yourself. Keep on
                        hoping. I know it's tiring, but at least
                         those hopes still have the probability of
                          coming true. I know it sounds so optimistic, 
                          but yeah. I have so much more to say, but 
                          as usual, I can't put it into words. Nevertheless, 
                          please know that you, too, are special to me.
                           All of you are dear to me. Whatever happens
                            in the future, I will still value this friendship. 
                            No matter how far we get from one another, I will
                             never forget how this friendship shaped me as a
                              person. Thank you as always. I wish you another 
                              year of finding joy and happiness.Â </p>

      <li>You, recovering little by little from all the wounds caused by your hardships</li>

      <p>It's hard for me, for us, to see you in a state of despair. Whenever you come to me and vent about your difficulties, I always think of wanting to fix it with just a snap of my hand. Well, if only that were possible, then I would. But then it isn't. If only people could just give away their lives or happiness for someone who needs it most, then that would actually be cool. Maybe I would just give mine to someone like you. I'm sorry if all I can do is listen to you. I'm sorry if I can't keep all those people away from you as much as I want to. I'm sorry if I can't keep all those sharp things from you just to keep you from hurting yourself. All I can do is listen, be there when I can, and wish you the best of luck.</p>
